# End-to-end tests

These tests run Diablo's programs as separate processes and talk to them over
real TCP connections, the way a peer or an operator would.

Each test builds a throwaway feeder site in a temporary directory: a
`diablo.config` whose `path_home` points there, `dnewsfeeds`, `dspool.ctl`,
and `diablo -d` (in the foreground) listening on a free port of 127.0.0.1. The
test talks to it and stops it with `dicmd exit`. Nothing outside the temporary
directory is touched, and the sites of different tests share nothing.

The tests are written in Go and use the
[nntp-testkit](https://github.com/go-while/nntp-testkit) library (standard
library only): a strict NNTP client that fails on bare LF line ends, bad
dot-stuffing, a missing `.` terminator or stray bytes after a reply, fake NNTP
peers, and `proc`, which starts and stops `diablo` and prints its output when a
test fails.

## What is covered

| test | programs | what it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `TestPeerIHAVE` | diablo | IHAVE from the peer (127.0.0.2) is accepted (335, 235); a second offer gets 435 |
| `TestStrangerRefused` | diablo | a host that no `dnewsfeeds` label lists gets `502 ... Transfer permission denied` |
| `TestDicmdConfig` | diablo, dicmd | `dicmd config maxconnect 17` is applied and reported; `path_dumphist` is rejected (startup only) |
| `TestGeneralLogNotWritable` | diablo | with an unwritable `path_generallog`, diablo reports it and keeps accepting articles instead of crashing |
| `TestHostCacheLastPeerRemoved` | diablo, dprimehostcache | removing the last `inhost` empties `dhosts.cache`, and the former peer gets a permission denial, not "label missing" |
| `TestHostCacheRebuildAfterFreshStart` | diablo | after a start without `dhosts.cache`, a peer added to `dnewsfeeds` is let in once the cache is rebuilt |
| `TestDnewslinkStreaming` | diablo, dicmd, dnewslink | queued articles reach a streaming peer (fake) in order, with TAKETHIS and no IHAVE |
| `TestDnewslinkIHAVEFallback` | diablo, dicmd, dnewslink | a peer that refuses MODE STREAM gets the articles with IHAVE |
| `TestDnewslinkPeerHas` | diablo, dicmd, dnewslink | an article the peer already has is not sent (CHECK gets 438); the others are |
| `TestDnewslinkLiteralPercentLabel` | diablo, dicmd, dnewslink | a `%` in a feed label remains literal in its queue path when `-S` is omitted |
| `TestDnewsfeedsHashfeedFiltersByMessageID` | diablo, dicmd | outgoing feed filtering splits Message-IDs correctly with all four MD5 word offsets (0, 4, 8, 12) and legacy quickhash (`@`) |
| `TestDspoolHashfeedSelectsSpoolByMessageID` | diablo, dicmd | complementary metaspool filters route each Message-ID to the matching spool with all four MD5 word offsets (0, 4, 8, 12) and legacy quickhash (`@`) |
| `TestArticleTypes` | dfeedtest | the ArtType (`lib/arttype.c`) of 34 sample articles: plain, MIME, html, control, cancel, postscript, partial, uuencode, base64, yEnc, PGP in every armor form, and others. Where the result is a misdetection (PGP signatures and keys taken for base64 binary, other PGP forms unrecognised, yEnc keyword orders, upper-case and unspaced headers, base64 text), the case pins today's result and says what it should be |
| `TestArticleTypesRoutedByArttypes` | diablo | an `arttypes binary` label gets a yEnc article and an `arttypes !binary` label a text one; a long PGP signature goes to the binary label today (pinned misdetection) |
| `TestDnewsfeedsLimitsDfeedtest` | dfeedtest | dnewsfeeds `maxsize`, `minsize` (with `k`), `maxcross`, `mincross`, `maxpath` and `minpath`: dfeedtest feeds an article only inside each range, with the edge values on both sides. `minsize` is exclusive and `maxsize` inclusive, and both are pinned |
| `TestDnewsfeedsLimitsLive` | diablo | the same six limits on a running diablo: an article outside the range does not reach the label's queue, one inside does |
| `TestStatWithLongSpoolPath` | diablo | STAT of a stored article answers 223 with a spool path of about 125 characters (D-62). **Fails** on main: 430 Article expired |
| `TestDnewsfeedsMaxconnect` | diablo | `maxconnect 2` in a dnewsfeeds label lets two parallel connections in and refuses the third with 502 (D-59). **Fails** on main: the third was accepted |
| `TestDhisexpireFailureKeepsHistoryAlive` | diablo, dhisexpire | a dhisexpire that fails after marking the history dead (backup directory missing) marks it alive again: dhistory is not dead and diablo still greets new connections (D-57). **Fails** on main |
| `TestDhisexpireKeepsBackup` | diablo, dhisexpire | a normal `dhisexpire -a -o file` installs the new history, replaces an earlier backup with the old file, leaves no temporary name, and diablo still knows the article |
| `TestDnewsfeedsDirectiveWithoutArgument` | dfeedtest | each numeric dnewsfeeds option (`maxparallel`, `port`, `priority`, `feedertxbuf`, ...) written without its value is a configuration error, not a crash (D-58). **Fails** on main: SIGSEGV |
| `TestDnewsfeedsReloadWithoutArgument` | diablo | saving such a line into dnewsfeeds of a running diablo does not take the master down (D-58). **Fails** on main (the master exits at the next reload); takes 33 s |
| `TestHostCacheEndEndsLabel` | diablo (dprimehostcache) | an `inhost` line after the `end` of a label is not entered into the host cache under that label (D-60). **Fails** on main |
| `TestHostCacheDiabloHostsForms` | diablo (dprimehostcache) | diablo.hosts takes an IPv6 address as well as the `host: label` and `host:label` forms (D-61). **Fails** on main: `2001:db8::25` became host `2001`, label `db8` |
| `TestReaderCheckgroupsControl` | dreaderd | an accepted checkgroups control message updates the description of an existing group and does not create a group it names that does not exist (D-53). **Fails** on main: `0 0 n` in LIST ACTIVE and `211 1 -1 -1` |
| `TestHostCacheLongLabel` | diablo (dprimehostcache) | a 3000-character label name in dnewsfeeds does not overflow the host cache loader's buffer; its hosts are left out and the next label is read. **Fails** on main (aborts or corrupts the stack) |
| `TestDnewslinkRefileKeepsFlags` | dnewslink | entries pending in a stream when the peer goes away come back to the queue file once each, with their `H` and `C<size>` flags (D-63). **Fails** on main: flags lost, one entry written twice |
| `TestFeederMaxHeaderSize` | diablo | an article with 130 KB of headers is refused under `feedermaxheadersize 2k`, and a normal article after it is accepted (D-56). **Fails** on main: the limit was never applied |
| `TestWeightedAllocationWithZeroWeights` | diablo | `allocstrat weighted` with every spool at `weight 0` starts and stores articles (D-64). **Fails** on main: SIGFPE at start |
| `TestReaderListActiveAfterRecordRewrite` | dreaderd | a reader that listed the groups before a control message rewrote a group record lists every group in its next LIST ACTIVE (D-54). **Fails** on main: the appended record was skipped once |
| `TestDnewslinkTermStalledPeer` | diablo, dnewslink | SIGTERM while dnewslink waits for a stalled peer (at the greeting, and on an unanswered CHECK/TAKETHIS): it exits within 5 s and both articles stay queued. **Fails** on main before this fix: dnewslink polled again for the full `-T` timeout (600 s) after the signal |
| `TestReaderFeedAndRead` | dreaderd, dgrpctl | an article fed to the reader by IHAVE shows in GROUP and OVER; BODY and ARTICLE fetch it from the spool server (fake) |
| `TestReaderQuitAlone` | dreaderd | QUIT gets 205 and nothing follows it |
| `TestReaderQuitWhileConnecting` | dreaderd | a client that QUITs while another connects gets 205 and nothing after it. **Fails** on main before jrehmer/diablo-nntp#12 (dreaderd wrote "400 Server too busy" after the 205 when its only DNS worker was busy) |
| `TestReaderPost` | dreaderd | POST is passed to the outgoing ('o') server (fake peer) with IHAVE: body as posted, the vserver's `postpath` in the Path |
| `TestReaderCapabilities` | dreaderd | CAPABILITIES (RFC 3977 §5.2): a reader connection lists VERSION 2, READER, OVER, LIST ACTIVE ACTIVE.TIMES NEWSGROUPS OVERVIEW.FMT DISTRIB.PATS, POST and IMPLEMENTATION, and each of them works; a feed-only connection lists IHAVE and STREAMING; MODE STREAM is 501 in reader mode. Then nntp-testkit's conformance checks run against the reader, and none may fail. **Fails** on main before #41: "500 What?" |
| `TestReaderReplyCodes` | dreaderd | RFC 3977 replies (D-44, D-45, D-47): 412 for LISTGROUP/NEXT/LAST without a group; 420 for ARTICLE/HEAD/BODY/STAT/NEXT/LAST/OVER/HDR in an empty group; LISTGROUP answers "211 count low high group" and honours a range; ARTICLE with a non-number, non-message-id argument is 501; HDR answers 225 (an absent header has an empty value), XHDR still 221; LIST HEADERS and LIST ACTIVE.TIMES answer 215; OVER with a range holding no article is 423, XOVER still an empty 224. **Fails** on main before this change |
| `TestReaderAuthinfoCodes` | dreaderd | AUTHINFO (RFC 4643, D-46): PASS before USER is 482, a wrong password 481, AUTHINFO after a successful login 502. **Fails** on main before this change |
| `TestReaderConformanceAuthinfo` | dreaderd | nntp-testkit's conformance checks against a reader that requires AUTHINFO (user `fred`), with the user and password given, so the six RFC 4643 checks run: login, a wrong password (481), PASS before USER (482), GROUP before login (480), AUTHINFO after login (502), and AUTHINFO gone from CAPABILITIES after login. All checks must pass; `mode-reader` is skipped (dreaderd answers 480 before login). One check at a time: the test reader has one DNS/auth worker (`readerdns 1`) and a concurrent login gets "400 Server too busy". **Fails** on main before #67 (D-46) |
| `TestReaderLoginsQueueForDNSWorker` | dreaderd | D-51: with one DNS/auth worker (`readerdns 1`), 8 logins at the same time all get 281. **Fails** on main before this change: some got "400 Server too busy" |
| `TestReaderDNSQueueLimit` | dreaderd | D-51: 40 logins at once against `readerdns 1`: each gets 281 or 400 (queue limit 4 * readerdns + 4), none hangs, and a login works afterwards |
| `TestFeederReplyCodes` | diablo | a transit-only server (D-48): MODE READER is 502, IHAVE and CHECK without a message-id 501. **Fails** on main before this change |
| `TestReaderBindHostPort` | dreaderd | `dreaderd -P 127.0.0.1:port` listens there. **Fails** on main before the -P fix: the whole "host:port" was passed to getaddrinfo |
| `TestReaderCacheHitsRepaired` | dreaderd | a damaged scoreboard (`cache.hits` whose header claims 1 MiB in a 20 KiB file) is replaced when dreaderd opens it with `readercache on` and `cache=scoring(...)`, and the replacement is logged. **Fails** on main before this fix (D-14): the file stays damaged and the scoreboard stays off. 64-bit little-endian only |
| `TestReaderCacheHeaderRewrite` | dreaderd | with `readercache on`, a repeated HEAD/ARTICLE is served from the article cache with the vserver's cluster name in `Xref:` (in place of the spool's host) and in front of `Path:`; an `Xref:` with a host but no groups and an empty `Path:` are passed on unchanged and the other headers and the body are intact. **Fails** on main before this fix: those two lines were rewritten with the rest of the article appended |
| `TestHeaderFeedToReader` | diablo, dnewslink, dreaderd | diablo feeds dreaderd a header-only feed (`headfeed on`, `dnewslink -H`); the reader shows the article in GROUP and OVER and fetches BODY from diablo as its spool server |
| `TestKPDBConcurrentUpdate` | dkp | two writers update one record with values of a new length while the test holds the record's lock, so the second waits inside its first lookup and finds a replaced record: exactly one live record must remain, with both changes. **Fails** on main before #33 (D-11): two live records for the key, one without the first writer's change |
| `TestDexpireKeeptimeTwoSpools` | dexpire | D-76: two spools with different directory ages and a keep time of 3600 s: the 42-minute-old directory of spool 01 must stay. **Fails** on main before #109: it is removed |
| `TestKPDBTornTail` | dkp | D-80: a KP database whose tail is a half-written record or a NUL block: the next append starts on a new line and is found. **Fails** on main before #110 |
| `TestDnewslinkDeferredKeptOnExit` | dnewslink | D-66: entries the peer deferred with 431 are written back to the queue, one per line, when the session ends early. **Fails** on main before #111 |
| `TestDcancelSpoolOnlyUpdatesHistory` | dcancel | D-67: `dcancel -a` and `-s` cancel the first of three articles; the other two stay readable (`-s` now updates the history). **Fails** on main before #112 for `-s` |
| `TestDnewslinkOverlongQueueLine, TestDnewslinkFullDiskKeepsQueue` | dnewslink | D-72: an overlong queue line is skipped, the entries behind it are sent. D-74 (root only, Linux): a queue rewrite onto a full file system keeps the old queue. **Fail** on main before #113 |
| `TestDnewslinkQueueFieldsPerLine` | dnewslink | D-73: after a reconnect a plain queue line does not inherit `C50` from the line before, and a retried entry keeps its flags. **Fails** on main before #114 |
| `TestDnewslinkSmallMaxstream` | dnewslink | D-68: `-M 2` with six queued articles offers all six. **Fails** on main before #117: two |
| `TestDnewslinkBadCompressLevel` | dnewslink | D-69: `-Z12` (a level zlib rejects) with a peer that accepts MODE COMPRESS: dnewslink ends by itself. **Fails** on main before #118: it spins |
| `TestDexpireCtlIndent, TestDexpireCtlLongComment, TestDexpireCtlLongPattern, TestConfigLongLine` | dexpire, diablo | D-83: an indented `dexpire.ctl` rule is honoured. D-82: long lines in `diablo.config` and `dexpire.ctl` are not split. **Fail** on main before #119 and #125 |
| `TestDicmdConfigInternalFilter` | dicmd, diablo | D-78: `dicmd config internalfilter B3` keeps the body filter working. **Fails** on main before #124: 8 of 8 identical bodies stored |
| `TestKPDBBlankLine` | dkp | D-79: a blank or short line in a KP database (also as the last line) does not corrupt the sort or crash the lookup. **Fails** on main before #123: SIGSEGV |
| `TestPathPatternPercent` | dpath | a configured path pattern (`path_log %s/lo%dg%%x`) expands with its first `%s` substituted, `%%` as `%`, and anything else literal; a pattern without `%s` stays as it is. **Fails** on main before this fix: the pattern was the snprintf format, so `%d` printed stack garbage (`lo32g%x`) |
| `TestDexpirecacheDefaultDir` | dexpirecache | without `-d`, with and without `-C`: works on the configured cache directory and reports nothing to do. **Fails** on main before this fix: chdir(NULL), exit 1. (The 2 TB overflow itself needs a file system that large.) |
| `TestDlockhistorySleepOption`, `TestDspaminfoClearNeedsCache` | dlockhistory, dspaminfo | `dlockhistory -f -s 1` keeps running; `dspaminfo -c 0` without `-B`/`-N` is refused. **Fail** on main before this fix: dlockhistory crashes (SIGSEGV), dspaminfo selects both caches |
| `TestDcancelDryRunDoesNotRewriteSpool`, `TestDcancelDryRunReaderDoesNotCancelOverview` | dcancel | `dcancel -a -n` skips the spool rewrite path, and `dcancel -n -r` skips the reader overview write; both report the planned cancellation and leave the article readable. **Fails** on main before this fix: `-n -r` cancelled the reader overview |
| `TestDclientOneLineReply` | dclient | `dclient DATE`, and GROUP and DATE on stdin, against a server with one-line replies: dclient returns with the replies. **Fails** on main before this fix: it waited for a `.` line and hung |
| `TestPlockExitStatus` | plock | plock returns the exit status of its command (0 and 3). **Fails** on main before this fix: always 0 |
| `TestDhisbenchNeedsScratchHistory` | dhisbench | adds without `-f` are refused and the site's dhistory is not created; with `-f` they go to the given file. **Fails** on main before this fix: the made-up entries went into dhistory |
| `TestMasscancelLastLine` | dgrpctl | `masscancel` with two invalid Message-IDs on stdin, the last without a newline: both are reported. **Fails** on main before D-17's loop fix: the last line was dropped |
| `TestConfigPathPercent` | dpath | a diablo.config in a directory named `c%dfg`, given with `-C file` and `-Cfile`, is read and its `path_home` used. **Fails** on main before D-50: the config path was the xfopen() format ("Unable to open diablo.config using pattern ...") |
| `TestCheckgroupsExec` | dgrpctl | `checkgroups exec` with a new group, a new moderated group, a changed description, an unchanged group and a group missing from the list: new groups get status `y`/`m`, a description and a creation time, the changed group its description, the missing group is deleted, and a second run changes nothing. **Fails** on main before D-36: new groups had only NB and NE (`flag=n`, no GD, CTS 0) |
| `TestPgpverify` | pgpverify | with a throwaway keyring (testdata/pgp, public key only): a signed newgroup verifies and names its signer; a changed signed header, a duplicate signed header or X-PGP-Sig (any letter case), a NUL byte or a bare CR are refused (exit 3, nothing on stdout). Skipped without gpgv |
| `TestControlDuplicateHeadersRefused` | dreaderd | a control message with two Control: headers is not executed, and the refusal is logged; one with a single Control: is (dcontrol.ctl `newgroup:*:*:doit`) |
| `TestDexpire` | diablo, dexpire | `dexpire -a` removes the spool directory of an article older than `keeptime`; STAT then gives 430, and offering the article again gets 435 (still in history) |
| `TestDexpireKeepsNewestDir` | diablo, dexpire | `dexpire -a` keeps a spool's newest directory even when it is older than `keeptime` (diablo may be writing into it): the article in it stays readable and the next one is stored. **Fails** on main before jrehmer/diablo-nntp#25 |
| `TestSpoolDirRemovedWhileWriting` | diablo | the spool directory a connection writes into is removed (as dexpire can do); the next article on the same connection is stored (235, then STAT 223) in a recreated directory. **Fails** on main before jrehmer/diablo-nntp#24 (235, then STAT 430: the article was lost) |
| `TestFeederChildSighupAfterQuit` | diablo | 400 rounds of QUIT, then SIGHUP to the feeder child (as `dicmd exit` and `dicmd pause` send) while it logs its session: no child may be left after 10 s. **Fails** on main before the D-40 fix: 85 to 169 of 1000 children hung in a futex wait inside the SIGHUP handler on glibc, 6 of 2000 on musl. Linux only (/proc); `E2E_SIGHUP_ROUNDS` sets the rounds |
| `TestDiabloCtlFeeder`, `TestDiabloCtlReader` | samples/adm/diablo-ctl | status (3 when stopped), start, a second start ("already running"), restart, stop (port closed), stop again; skipped without the script (`DIABLO_CTL`, default: `samples/adm/diablo-ctl` next to `DIABLO_BIN`) |
| `TestDiabloCtlOnlyItsOwnSite` | samples/adm/diablo-ctl, diablo | `diablo-ctl stop` acts on its own site only: another site of the same user, started first, keeps its diablo and its dnewslink worker (a stand-in in its dqueue); the site's own worker is stopped; diablo writes `log/diablo.pid` and removes it on exit. **Fails** on main before #31: diablo-ctl reported and killed the other site's diablo and dnewslink. The diablo-ctl tests skip an old diablo-ctl that still looks for "the oldest diablo of the user" |
| `TestCanLockVectors` | (Go only) | the Go Cancel-Lock helpers reproduce INN's test vectors (tests/lib/canlock-t.c) |
| `TestCancelLock`, `TestCancelLockSupersedes`, `TestCancelLockEarlyCancel`, `TestCancelLockTrackonlyRefused` | dreaderd | `readercanlock` (RFC 8315): cancels and supersedes against Cancel-Lock in each mode (require-auth, auth, none, all), matching, wrong and missing keys, sha1 in a folded lock with a comment, early cancels, and the trackonly refusal; skipped without readercanlock support |
| `TestDnewslinkConnlife` | diablo, dspoolout, dnewslink | realtime feed with `connlife 8` (skipped without `dnewslink -K`): one TCP session across a queue rotation; after connlife, retirement at the next rotation and a replacement at once (`dspoolout -J`); no descriptor growth over three replacements; every article reaches the peer once, in order. Linux only (reads /proc) |
| `TestDnewslinkConnlifeNearest` | diablo, dspoolout, dnewslink | with `connlife 12`, a replacement worker that carries traffic retires at the rotation 10 s after its start (the one nearest 12 s), not at the next one about 20 s in. **Fails** on main before #30: the worker is still serving 12 s after its start (connlife 60 gave about 120 s). Linux only (reads /proc) |
| `TestInstallConfigFiles` | install-portable.sh | `make install` into a temporary prefix: config files are real 0640 copies of the samples, `dactive.kp` is empty, adm scripts in `<prefix>/adm` keep the execute bit; a reinstall keeps a changed config file and puts a changed adm script's new version next to it (`.new`); uninstall leaves the configuration. Skipped without `install-portable.sh` next to `DIABLO_BIN` |
| `TestInstallConvertsConfigSymlinks` | install-portable.sh | a config symlink into `samples/` left by an earlier install becomes a real file with the content in use, before `samples/` is replaced; with install and with bininstall |
| `TestAdmHourlyExpire` | adm/hourly.expire, dexpire | the script expires an article older than `keeptime` |
| `TestAdmDailyAtrim` | adm/daily.atrim, adm/rot | the script rotates the logs |
| `TestAdmBiweeklyAtrim` | adm/biweekly.atrim, dhisexpire | the script trims the history while diablo runs; the stored article stays in history |
| `TestAdmReaderScripts` | adm/daily.reader, adm/weekly.reader | both scripts run on a reader site. The adm tests are skipped while `samples/adm` still holds the csh scripts |
| `TestModerationMailsModerator`, `TestModerationFirstModeratorOnly` | dreaderd | an unapproved POST to a moderated group is mailed to the moderator (moderators file, `%s` = group with dashes) with 240 and not passed on; the address is an argument to sendmail, without `-t`; a crosspost is mailed only to the first moderated group's moderator (#45; before, every moderator got a copy). Mail content is checked only with `ci/fake-sendmail` installed (`E2E_FAKE_SENDMAIL=1` for `ci/build-on-host`, as in CI) |
| `TestModerationApproveRequired`, `TestModerationApprovedGoesIn` | dreaderd | readerdef `approve` (#42): a POST with Approved: from a reader without `approve yes` gets 441, to a moderated and to an unmoderated group, and nothing is mailed or passed on; with `approve yes` it goes straight out. **Fails** on main before #42: any reader's Approved: post went out |
| `TestModerationGroupStatus` | dreaderd | group status on POST (#43): a group with status "n" or "x", alone or crossposted, gets `441 Posting to <group> is not allowed (status <c>)`, with or without `checkpostgroups`; the open group still posts. **Fails** on main before #43: the "n" post went out |
| `TestModerationNoModerator441`, `TestModerationMailFailureReported`, `TestModerationAddressFormat` | dreaderd | #45: no moderators line gives `441 No moderator known for <group>, article not posted`; a failing sendmail gives `441 Unable to mail article to the moderator of <group>`; neither is passed on (before: passed on, or 240). In the moderators file `%s` and `%%` are substituted and any other `%` makes the entry unusable (before: snprintf with the entry as the format) |
| `TestModerationAliasStatus` | dreaderd, dgrpctl | #50: a group whose status is an INN alias (`=comp.unix.mx`) posts normally, neither refused as n/x nor mailed as moderated (before: refused) |
| `TestFeederUnapprovedModerated` | diablo | with `active on`, `activedrop yes` and `xrefhost`, an unapproved article to a moderated group gets 437 with the reason `Unapproved/<group>` in the reply and in incoming.log (#46; before, "NotInActive" in incoming.log only); an article to an open group is accepted |

## Running

You need a Diablo build and Go 1.26 or later. A user and group called `news`
must exist: `diablo` looks them up at startup and exits without them.

```sh
make                      # with RADIUS_ENABLED off in lib/vendor.h on Linux
cd tests/e2e
DIABLO_BIN=$PWD/../../dbin go test ./...
```

Without `DIABLO_BIN` every test is skipped. `NNTP_TEST_DEADLINE` (default
`60s`) bounds every blocking step, so a hung server fails the test instead of
hanging it.

Prefer a test machine. Each test starts its own daemons in a temporary
directory on free ports, and the tests only signal processes of their own
sites. But they run as `news`, like a live site, and a bug there can reach the
live daemons: before jrehmer/diablo-nntp#31, `TestDiabloCtl*` (through
diablo-ctl) stopped the live diablo, dreaderd and dnewslink of the same user.

Run the tests as an ordinary user or as `news`, not as root. As an ordinary
user, `diablo`'s switch to `news` fails and it keeps running as that user,
which owns the test sites.

The tests need a system where 127.0.0.2 can be used as a source address.
Linux routes all of 127.0.0.0/8 to the loopback interface. Elsewhere add the
address first:

- FreeBSD and macOS: `ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2/32`
- illumos (SmartOS, OmniOS): `ipadm create-addr -T static -a 127.0.0.2/32 lo0/e2e`

`TestDnewslinkConnlife` reads `/proc` and is skipped off Linux.

`ci/build-on-host` installs the build packages (apt, dnf, zypper, pacman, apk or emerge), creates the
`news` user, turns RADIUS off and builds; run it as root from the top of a
throwaway copy of the source tree. The test binary can be built elsewhere
with `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -c` and copied to a machine without Go.
`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` does the same on GitHub's Ubuntu runners.

## Writing a test

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	s := NewSite(t, SiteOptions{})      // diablo with DefaultNewsfeeds: 127.0.0.2 may feed
	p := s.Peer(t)                      // dial from 127.0.0.2, read the greeting
	id := msgID(t)
	expect(t, p, 335, "IHAVE %s", id)
	send(t, p, wire(newArticle(id, "e2e.test", "subject", "body")))
	status(t, p, 235, "IHAVE article")
	s.Dicmd(t, "status")                // dicmd with the site's DIABLO_CONFIG_PATH
}
```

`SiteOptions` adds or replaces `diablo.config` directives, replaces
`dnewsfeeds` or `dspool.ctl`, writes further files, and runs a `Setup`
function before `diablo` starts (e.g. `PrimeHostCache`).
