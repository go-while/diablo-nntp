# Known Issues

Findings about Diablo 6 since the 6-CUR-20261024-BWH release (2026-10-24). They come from
the end-to-end tests in `tests/e2e` (PR #11), builds on 21 systems (FreeBSD, SmartOS, 19
Linux distributions, Debian GNU/Hurd), and code review. [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) tracks how
much of the code has been reviewed.

Line numbers refer to `main` at `ed3ce67` unless a PR is named. "Verified" means checked
against the code by reading it; "from review" means reported by a review pass and not
re-checked yet.

Status values: **open**, **PR** (fix waiting for review, with its number), **fixed** (with
the PR that fixed it), **decision** (needs the maintainer to decide), **won't fix**.

Last updated 2026-10-27: D-66 to D-89 added from the second review pass and the reviews of the fixes
(D-77 is documented behaviour and only needs a note); the fixed ones are marked with their PR. Before that, D-53 to D-65 added from the review of `main` at `ca648d4`. Before that, 2026-10-26, after batch 1 (#30, #31, #37 to #44, #47 to #49) and the first part
of batch 2 (#46, #50, #52, #62) were merged. Open: #35 (GnuPG pgpverify, held for a private
advisory), #45 with its tests in #56, #53 to #55, #57 to #61, #63 to #65.

## Details

### D-01 Host cache never rebuilt after a start without dhosts.cache
`util/diablo.c` waited for the startup rebuild with `waitpid()` but left `HostCachePid` set,
and the main loop only rebuilds while it is 0. After a first start (or a deleted cache),
peers added to or removed from `dnewsfeeds` were ignored until a restart.
Test: `TestHostCacheRebuildAfterFreshStart`.

### D-02 Privilege drop results not checked
`diablo`, `dreaderd` and `dstart` ignored the results of `setgroups`, `setgid` and `setuid`.
A failure while root left the daemon running as root.

### D-03 Non-root start refused after D-02
The first D-02 fix exited on any failure, but `setgroups()` is root-only, so a start as an
ordinary user (or as `news`) now exited: "Unable to set supplementary groups to news". Fixed
by changing user only when `geteuid() == 0`. Found by every e2e test (they run as `news`).

### D-04 Write through a NULL pointer in FeedWrite()
`lib/newsfeed.c`. Found and fixed by the maintainer.

### D-05 const strchr() warnings with glibc 2.43 or later
11 `-Wdiscarded-qualifiers` warnings on Fedora 46 and Arch (glibc returns `const char *` for
a `const` argument).

### D-06 dreaderd writes 400 too busy after a 205
At session end the reader child hands the descriptor back to the master for accounting
(`DR_SESSEXIT_RPT`). With no free DNS worker, `SendDns()` wrote `400 Server too busy` to the
client that had already received `205` for QUIT, and closed the descriptor the caller closes
again. Reproduced on every run with `readerdns 1`, and on Rocky 10 with plain sequential
connects. Test: `TestReaderQuitWhileConnecting`.

### D-07 dreaderd cleanup can close another client's descriptor
`SendDns()` recorded the accounting descriptor in `d_FdPend`; the caller closes it and the
accounting reply never clears it. When that DNS worker died later, the `wait3()` cleanup
closed whatever descriptor had reused the number. No test (needs a worker to die).

### D-08 dreaderd -P host:port does not bind
For an unbracketed `host:port`, `-P` and `-B` passed the whole string as the host to
`getaddrinfo()` and dreaderd exited; only `[host]:port` worked. In the 2017 source too.
Test: `TestReaderBindHostPort`.

### D-09 dreaderd does not build with musl
`dreaderd/filealloc.c` casts to `loff_t`, a glibc type. Alpine 3.22 to 3.24 built 38 of 39
programs, without dreaderd.

### D-10 diablo -b falls through into -A
`case 'b'` had no `break`. dstart passes `-b<fd>`, so the news admin became the descriptor
number ("contact 5"); `-b <fd>` swallowed the next argument.

### D-11 KPDB deletes the wrong record on a race
In #7 (`lib/kpdb.c:857` on that branch), the `-` delete marker is written at `lockoff` from
the first, unlocked lookup instead of the record the locked second lookup found. A create
race writes `-` at offset 0 (the header) and leaves two live records; two writers on one
record also leave duplicates. Needs no I/O error. Details in the #7 review.
#7 was merged with it; fixed in #33 (the `-` goes to the record the merge read). Test:
`TestKPDBConcurrentUpdate` (#36), which holds the record lock between two writers' lookups.

### D-12 A dead DNS worker can be picked for a new client
In #7 (`dreaderd/main.c:1615` on that branch), the new EOF path sets `d_Count = 0` before
`wait3()` reaps the worker, so `SendDns()` can choose it: the pending client's descriptor
leaks and the new client hangs. Details in the #7 review.
#7 was merged with it; fixed in #34 (a `d_Dead` flag; `wait3()` keeps the cleanup). No test:
the window is the microseconds while the worker exits.

### D-13 Interrupted KPDB sort marker is negative as int
In #7, an interrupted sort leaves `FFFFFFFF` in the append counter; `int cval` makes it -1,
so the sort runs without the forced remap. Use `0FFFFFFF`, as the creation header does.
Fixed in #33.

### D-14 A damaged cache.hits is refused forever
In #7, `OpenCacheHits()` re-initializes only for a bad magic; a structurally bad file (the
state the old growth bug left) disables scoreboard caching until an admin deletes it.
On main since #7 was merged; fix in #40.

### D-15 dreaderd has no CAPABILITIES
`CAPABILITIES` answers `500 What?`. Clients that need it can't detect `READER`, `OVER`,
`MODE-READER`, `STREAMING` or `AUTHINFO`, and nntp-testkit's RFC 3977 conformance checks
skip almost everything (MODE STREAM works but isn't advertised).

### D-16 Linux build fails with the default lib/vendor.h
`RADIUS_ENABLED`, `DB_ENABLED` and `REJECT_DB` come from the XS4ALL site-configuration patch
(30_diablo-xs4all-config.patch). Linux has no BSD libradius (`radlib.h`), so the default
build fails there. The maintainer keeps them as admin opt-ins; the README should say to turn
RADIUS off on Linux (`tests/e2e/ci/build-on-host` does).

### D-17 Unchecked results under _FORTIFY_SOURCE
Ubuntu and Gentoo enable `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` by default: 122 to 133 `-Wunused-result` warnings
on 6-CUR-20261024-BWH, 80 after #5 to #9 (mostly `write()` in `util/` and
`dreaderd/main.c`). Debian, Fedora, RHEL-family and openSUSE show none.

### D-18 Debian GNU/Hurd build
`PATH_MAX` is undefined on Hurd (`lib/defs.h:580`); `dreaderd/main.c` uses `setpgrp(0, 0)`
because `USE_SYSV_SETPGRP` isn't set for Hurd; `dreaderd/dns.c:19` picks `db_185.h` only for
`__linux__`/`__sun`. Low priority for the maintainer.

### D-19 CHANGELOG links a missing document
`CHANGELOG.md` links `BUILD-PORTABLE-MAKE.md`, which isn't in the repository. The maintainer
has the file.

### D-20 strncpy truncation warning in dreaderd/dns.c
GCC 16 (Fedora 46): `-Wstringop-truncation` at `dreaderd/dns.c:2143`, copying 127 bytes into
`dr_ReaderName`.

### D-21 dactive.kp write errors now exit the process
With #7, `KPDBFatalIO` calls `exit(1)` on any failed dactive.kp write, which is on the
per-article path of diablo children and dreaderd feeds. A full disk now stops those
processes instead of silently corrupting the file. Probably intended; needs a decision.

### D-22 GNU make install ignores PREFIX and DESTDIR
`install-portable.sh` reads PREFIX, DESTDIR, owner and group as arguments; the GNU `Makefile`
passed them as environment variables. `gmake DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install` (as README.md
documents it) installed into the live `/news`, `gmake DESTDIR=... uninstall` removed the live
`/news/dbin/*`. BSDmakefile passes arguments. Verified, and tested before/after on Debian 13.

### D-23 feeder+reader sample config is ignored
`samples/feeder+reader/diablo.config` has no `version 2.0` line, so `lib/config.c` skips every
directive silently: `feederbindport 120` and `active on` don't apply, and diablo binds 119 next
to dreaderd. Verified (no `version` line). The other two samples got it in 6-CUR-20261024-BWH.
Fixed in #26.

### D-24 Sample dreader.access allows 1.0.0.0/8, not localhost
`samples/dreader.access:415` has `access 1/8 ro`: that is the APNIC block 1.0.0.0/8, and there is
no localhost or RFC 1918 entry, so the first `telnet localhost 119` is refused. From review.

### D-25 Installed config files are read-only symlinks into samples
`install-portable.sh` symlinks `/news/diablo.config` and the other config files to `samples/*`
(mode 444) and overwrites `samples/*` on every install or bininstall, so edits made through the
symlink are lost. The installed `dactive.kp` is a 1998 sample with 44 comp.sys.amiga groups.
From review.

Fixed in #21: config files are installed as real 0640 copies and never overwritten; symlinks
from an earlier install become real files before `samples/` is replaced; `dactive.kp` starts
empty. Tests: `TestInstallConfigFiles`, `TestInstallConvertsConfigSymlinks`.

### D-26 ITER written as decimal, read as hex
`dreaderd/group.c:904` and `util/dcancel.c` write `ITER` with `%06d`; `util/dexpireover.c:414`
reads it with base 16. From iteration 10 on they disagree, and the value is used for overview
data file names, so dexpireover may work on the wrong files. Verified (the format mismatch);
the consequences still need tracing.

### D-27 Documentation is stale or wrong
- INSTALL: "XMake is required", `xmake install`, config files "in /news/etc" (they are read
  from `/news`), `/news/logs` (is `/news/log`), no `/news/run`, `/news/feeds`, csh.
- README.md: no Linux step to turn RADIUS off (D-16); package lists only for dnf, without
  compiler; no step to create user, group and `/news`; a non-default PREFIX doesn't change

### D-28 Man pages
Checked all 24 pages against the code; none is fully accurate. 17 built programs have no page
(didate, diconvhist, diload, dspaminfo, pgpverify, dprimehostcache, dstart, dclient,
dlockhistory, dfeedtest, dhisbench, dhisctl, dexpirecache, dcancel, dexpirescoring, plock,
showlocks); `-C` and `-V` are undocumented almost everywhere; the shared SEE ALSO footer lists
missing pages and leaves out existing ones. Largest gaps: diablo.8 (options, NNTP commands,
stale expire and logging sections), dicmd.8 and drcmd.8 (most commands missing),
diablo-files.5 (almost no diablo.config directives, a "ME" label that doesn't exist, obsolete
diablo.hosts lookup), dspoolout.8, dnewslink.8, dexpire.8. From review; the per-page list is in
the description of the pull request that added this file.

### D-29 dreaderd -S<digits> sets a mangled receive buffer
In `dreaderd/main.c` `case 'S'`, the digit cases set TxBufSize and fall through into `case 'R'`,
which skips one character and sets RxBufSize from the rest: `-S8192` sets a 192-byte receive
buffer. Verified.

### D-30 diablo -x sets the Xref host, not xrefsync
`util/diablo.c` `case 'x'` calls `SetCommand("feederxrefhost", ...)` like `-X`, so
`feederxrefsync` can't be set from the command line, although Usage says `-x xrefsync`.
Verified.

### D-31 Option parsing bugs in utilities
- `dilookup -f FILE` / `-h FILE` use `*ptr ? ptr : ptr + 1` and only work by accident (reading
  past the option string). Verified.
- `-C file` with a space: drequeue, dfeedinfo and dreadover take the file name as the next
  argument (label, host or ID); dicmd and drcmd skip only `-C`. From review.
- `dhisexpire -o file` with a space silently uses `.bak` and takes `file` as the history file;
  `drequeue -d` eats the label; `diloadfromspool -e` requires `-F` and `-u`. From review.
- Follow-up: `dlockhistory -s` did not consume its sleep-time argument, and `dexpirescoring`
  and `dprimehostcache` did not skip the argument to `-C file`. Fixed in #70.

### D-32 drcmd exits 1 after a good status
`util/drcmd.c` exits 0 only after a `.` line, and dreaderd sends none after `status`, so
`drcmd status` exits 1 even when dreaderd answers. Verified (found while writing diablo-ctl,
which works around it).

### D-33 dreaderd -B host without port binds a random port
With INET6 the `-B host` branch passes a NULL port; the `readerbindport` fallback exists only in
the non-INET6 branch. Any `-P`/`-B` also drops `readerbindhost`/`readerbindport` from
diablo.config. From review.

### D-34 Installed adm scripts are not executable
`install-portable.sh` copies `samples/` with mode 444 (xmake kept 755 for executable sources);
nothing creates `/news/adm`, but `crontab.sample` runs `cd adm; ./$i`. All adm scripts are
csh, which Debian, Ubuntu and Alpine don't install by default. From review.

Fixed in #21 (scripts installed executable into `<prefix>/adm`; a changed script gets the new
version as `.new`) and #22 (the scripts are POSIX sh). Tests: `TestInstallConfigFiles`,
`TestAdm*`.

### D-35 Samples with wrong directives or options
`samples/dexpire.ctl` says `dexpireover -w` compresses (it's `-z`); `samples/diablo.config:60`
`path_dspoolctl %s/dspoolctl` (file is `dspool.ctl`); `samples/feeder/diablo.config`
`internalfilter 16` (invalid) and `feederfilter /news/dbin/filter/spamfilter` (never built);
`crontab.sample` `biweekly.*` also matches `biweekly.atrim.dexpire`, a duplicate of
`old.biweekly.atrim.dexpire`; the `dcontrol.ctl` header describes `mail`/empty-value semantics
the code doesn't implement. From review.

#22 removed `biweekly.atrim.dexpire` and gave `crontab.sample` absolute paths; the other
points are open.

### D-36 dgrpctl checkgroups exec
New groups created by `checkgroups exec` get no S or GD fields, and the lock order is wrong when
modifying (`util/dgrpctl.c:770-790`). From review.

### D-37 Articles lost when the spool directory is removed
`util/diablo.c` `ArticleFile()` keeps the spool file it writes into open, and `lib/xopen.c`
caches the current directory. When the directory was removed (by dexpire, see D-38, or by
hand), diablo kept appending to the unlinked file and answered 235, but the article was gone
(STAT 430) and the log showed IOError and "Missing dir" lines. Found by the maintainer on a
ZFS feeder. Fixed in #24: a cached file with no links left is reopened, the directory cache is
reset, and a missing directory is created again ("spool directory ... was missing, created
it"). Test: `TestSpoolDirRemovedWhileWriting`.

### D-38 dexpire removes the directory diablo writes into
`util/dexpire.c` `cleanupDirectories()` removes the oldest directories of a partition until
`minfree` is met, and could reach the newest one, which diablo is writing into. With a large
`minfree` and ZFS, which reports freed space late, it emptied whole partitions. Fixed in #25:
each partition's newest directory is kept ("Keeping ..."). Test: `TestDexpireKeepsNewestDir`.

### D-39 dreaderd spool server address may be UDP
`dreaderd/server.c` `AddServer()` calls `getaddrinfo()` without `ai_socktype` and connects to
the first result. FreeBSD lists the UDP address first, so the reader could not reach its spool
servers. Found by the maintainer on FreeBSD; fixed in #27 (`SOCK_STREAM`).

### D-40 Feeder children hang on SIGHUP
`dicmd exit` and `dicmd pause` send SIGHUP to every feeder child. The child's `sigHup()` did
its cleanup in the handler (fflush, `LogSession()` through syslog, `exit()`). When the
signal arrived while the child was itself in syslog, stdio or malloc (typically logging its
session after QUIT), it waited forever on that lock and kept its client socket and dhistory
open. Found by the 20-VM run (two children left on Gentoo). Fixed in #32: the handler only
sets a flag and shuts the session socket down. Test: `TestFeederChildSighupAfterQuit` (85 to
169 of 1000 children hung before on glibc, 6 of 2000 on musl).

### D-41 diablo-ctl stops other sites' daemons
diablo-ctl (#17, #23) took "the oldest diablo of the user" for its site's master, and
stopped every dnewslink of the user. Running the e2e tests as `news` on hosts with a live
site stopped the live diablo, dreaderd and dnewslink (the SmartOS feeder for 28 minutes).
PR #31: diablo writes `<path_log>/diablo.pid`, diablo-ctl uses only pid files and the
site's dqueue for dnewslink. Test: `TestDiabloCtlOnlyItsOwnSite`.

### D-42 dnewslink ignores SIGTERM on a stalled peer
dnewslink's handler only sets `TermFlag`, but its waits for the peer are `poll()` calls with
the `-T` timeout (600 s); a signal interrupted one poll and the next started. A SIGTERM'd
worker on a hung peer stayed for many minutes (the maintainer had to kill -9). PR #37.
Test: `TestDnewslinkTermStalledPeer`.

### D-43 Connlife retires one rotation late
A connlife worker can only retire at a queue rotation and retired at the first one at or
after connlife; a replacement starts just after a rotation, so at the next multiple it is
a second short and serves a whole extra interval. Found by the maintainer. PR #30 (the
rotation nearest connlife), test #38 (`TestDnewslinkConnlifeNearest`).

### D-44 LISTGROUP reply and range
Found by the conformance sweep with nntp-testkit (RFC 3977 section 6.1.2). `LISTGROUP group`
answers `211 Article list follows` instead of `211 count low high group`
(`dreaderd/list.c:512`); a range (`LISTGROUP g 2-2`) is ignored and the whole group listed
(list.c:494-500); LISTGROUP with no group selected gives 481, an authentication code, instead
of 412 (list.c:520).
Fixed in #67: `211 count low high group` (GROUP and LISTGROUP share `SelectGroup()`), ranges,
and 412. Test: `TestReaderReplyCodes`.

### D-45 HDR reply code and LIST HEADERS
`HDR` answers 221, XHDR's code, instead of 225 (`dreaderd/xover.c:205`), and `LIST HEADERS`,
which RFC 3977 section 8.6 requires with HDR, gives `501 Bad command use`
(`dreaderd/reader.c:1318`). #41 doesn't advertise HDR because of this.
Fixed in #67: HDR answers 225 (XHDR keeps 221) and LIST HEADERS answers 215. Left out on
purpose: the message-id form of HDR and OVER (they answer 503), so HDR and LIST HEADERS stay
unadvertised in CAPABILITIES, as RFC 3977 requires that form.

### D-46 AUTHINFO reply codes
RFC 4643 section 2.3.2: a wrong password should get 481 and let the client retry; dreaderd
answers `502 Access denied to your node` (`dreaderd/main.c:1739`). AUTHINFO PASS before USER
gives 501 instead of 482 (nntp.c:104), and AUTHINFO after a successful login is accepted
again (381) instead of 502 (nntp.c:86).
Fixed in #67: 481, 482 and 502. Left out on purpose: a retry in the same session. After AUTHINFO
PASS the reader hands the connection back to the master for a fresh access check, and on a
failure the master writes 481 and closes the connection, so the client reconnects to try
again. Tests: `TestReaderAuthinfoCodes`, and nntp-testkit's six RFC 4643 checks in
`TestReaderConformanceAuthinfo`.

### D-47 Other reader reply codes
RFC 3977: NEXT with no group selected gives 421 instead of 412 (`dreaderd/nntp.c:264`);
ARTICLE or STAT in an empty group 423 instead of 420 (nntp.c:423); `ARTICLE abc` or `-1` 430
instead of 501 (nntp.c:331-334); OVER past the high mark (or a range like 3-1) sends 224 and an
empty list instead of 423, because 224 goes out before the range is checked (xover.c:208);
LIST ACTIVE.TIMES gives 500 instead of 215 or 503 (list.c:364).
Fixed in #67 (ACTIVE.TIMES is now listed in CAPABILITIES; its creator is `unknown`, which Diablo
doesn't record). Test: `TestReaderReplyCodes`.

### D-48 Feeder reply codes
diablo answers MODE READER with 500 instead of 502 (a transit-only server, RFC 3977 section
5.3; `util/diablo.c:2534`), and IHAVE or CHECK without an argument with 435/438 instead of 501.
All 15 of nntp-testkit's RFC 4644/IHAVE checks pass otherwise.
Fixed in #67. Test: `TestFeederReplyCodes`.

### D-49 Moderation handling
The maintainer's list (agent-chatroom, 2026-10-26), confirmed live: any reader can post with
Approved: straight into a moderated group (no readerdef setting; `dreaderd/post.c:256`); a POST
to a status "n" group is accepted; a crosspost to two moderated groups mails both moderators
(RFC 5537: the first only); with no moderators match the post goes to diablo, which rejects it
as "NotInActive" (and only `incoming.log` has the reason); mail failures are ignored, and
without any sendmail the client still gets "240 Article mailed to moderator" while the article
is lost; the moderators address goes through snprintf as the format (post.c:957). Fixes in #42,
#43, #45 and #46; tests in #44.

### D-50 CodeQL robustness findings
From the triage of the CodeQL alerts (advanced setup, #48). None of these is reachable from
the network; the sources are configuration and the command line of non-setuid programs.
- `util/dspoolout.c:471` and `:689`: the feed label (dnewsfeeds, dnntpspool.ctl) becomes the
  format of `xopen()`. A `%` in a label opens the wrong file or crashes dspoolout. Fix:
  `xopen(..., "%s", spoolFile)`, and reject `%` in labels.
- `util/dspoolout.c:774` / `util/dnewslink.c:597`: the label goes unescaped into dnewslink's
  `-b` template (`label.S%05d`), and dnewslink expands it with an unbounded `sprintf` into a
  1024-byte buffer. Fix: escape `%` in the label and use `snprintf`.
- `lib/config.c:187`: the diablo.config path (`DIABLO_CONFIG_PATH`, `-C`) is the format of
  `xfopen()`, the same class as the path patterns #62 fixed. A `%` in that path gives a wrong
  path. Fix: the same substitution as #62's `PatSubst()`.
- `dreaderd/reader.c:1100`: the bytelimit log line prints a `double` with `%d`, so both logged
  numbers are wrong. Fix: `%.0f`.
- `dreaderd/reader.c:215`: the select error log passes two `fd_set` structures to `%x`, so the
  values are meaningless. Fix: log something else.
Of the 72 format-string alerts, 52 went away with #62; the rest are these and integer-width
mismatches that only shorten a printed number.

### D-51 Logins beyond `readerdns` are turned away, not queued
Each new reader connection, and each AUTHINFO login, goes through one of dreaderd's DNS/auth
workers (`readerdns`, default 5). When all of them are busy, the next one is not queued: the
client gets `400 <host>: Server too busy - please try later` and is disconnected
(`dreaderd/main.c:1536`, logged as "Unable to find spare DNS thread"). A short burst of logins
larger than `readerdns` therefore disconnects some clients, even though each worker is only
busy for a moment. Seen in the e2e suite: with `readerdns 1`, two conformance checks logging in
at the same time got 400. Fix: queue the request until a worker is free (with a time limit),
or at least document that `readerdns` must cover the expected number of logins arriving at
once.
Fixed: SendDns() keeps such a request in a queue in the master (at most 4 * `readerdns` + 4
entries, in order) until a worker is free; a request that waits 10 s, or finds the queue full,
gets the same 400, and a client that closes while waiting is dropped. Tests:
`TestReaderLoginsQueueForDNSWorker`, `TestReaderDNSQueueLimit`.

### D-53 checkgroups creates half-formed groups
`dreaderd/control.c:951`. A checkgroups control message that is accepted (`doit`) writes the
description of a group named in its body that does not exist. The group then appears in LIST
ACTIVE as `0 0 n`, and `GROUP` answers `211 1 -1 -1`: the record has no creation status or
article numbers. Fix: write the description only when the record exists, or create a complete
record. Reproduced.

### D-54 Transient LIST ACTIVE gap after a record is rewritten
`lib/kpdb.c:529` (`KPDBScanFirst`), triggered by `CtlNewGroup` and `CtlCheckGroups` in
`dreaderd/control.c`. When a control message rewrites an existing group record, the next LIST
ACTIVE omits that group and the one after lists it again; appended groups are seen at once.
Reproduced. Cause (from reading): the scan walks the mapping it already has, and the append
counter does not change when a record is rewritten. Fix: bump the counter on a rewrite, or
remap at the start of a scan.

### D-55 dreaderd small items
From reading, not run: `dreaderd/dns.c:365`, `:491`, `:560` and `:584`: a `!`-prefixed deny
file, cdb or db returns without closing its handle, which leaks a descriptor in the DNS worker
for each matching login (the `!` form is undocumented). `dreaderd/xover.c`
(`NNStartListOverviewRange`): the OVER/XOVER range is only clamped to the group's low and high
marks, so a very wide range (possible in xref-slave mode) is walked in one pass.

### D-56 `feedermaxheadersize` is never enforced
`util/diablo.c:3004-3007`, `:2824`, `:3060`. `headerLen` is still 0 when it is compared with
`FeederMaxHeaderSize` (it is set after the blank line, once `inHeader` is cleared), so
`LAERR_HEADERTOOBIG` never fires and headers can be as large as `feedermaxartsize` (10 MB by
default). Reproduced: with `feedermaxheadersize 2k`, an article with about 130 KB of headers is
accepted (235). Fix: compare the running header byte count.

### D-57 dhisexpire leaves the history dead when it fails
`util/dhisexpire.c:311-350` and `Fail()` at `:512-521`. With `USE_DEADMAGIC` (the default),
dhisexpire writes the dead magic into the live dhistory and only then does the backup `link()`
and `rename()`. A failure after that (an unwritable `-o` directory, another file system, a write
error, a kill) prints "keeping old history" but never restores the magic, and every new feeder
connection exits in `HistoryOpen` until `dhisexpire -u`. Reproduced with
`dhisexpire -a -o /missing/dir/x.bak dhistory`. The previous backup is also removed before the
link. Fix: call `DoUnDead()` from `Fail()` and from a signal handler once the mark is written, and
do the link checks before the mark.

### D-58 dnewsfeeds directive without an argument crashes
`lib/newsfeed.c:1626-1812`. Directives such as `feedertxbuf`, `feederrxbuf`, `startdelay`,
`delayfeed`, `delayinfeed`, `transmitbuf`, `receivebuf`, `setqos`/`settos`, `maxparallel`,
`maxqueue`, `compress`, `maxstream`, `queueskip`, `priority` and `port` pass a NULL argument to
`atoi()`/`strtol()` when the value is missing. `dfeedtest` and every other program that loads
dnewsfeeds crash with SIGSEGV, and diablo, which reloads dnewsfeeds about once a minute, loses
its master when such a line is saved. Reproduced for `maxparallel`, `port`, `priority`,
`feederrxbuf` and `startdelay`, and for the reload. `lib/spool.c` `loadSpoolCtl` has the same
pattern (from reading). Fix: `if (nf && s2)`, as the other directives do.

### D-59 Per-label maxconnect allows one too many
`lib/newsfeed.c:306` tests `*pcount > nf_MaxConnect`, but the count (`util/diablo.c:1170-1177`) is
the number of existing connections, without the new one. `maxconnect 2` on a label lets three
connections in (the fourth gets 502); the global `maxconnect` uses `>=` and is right.
Reproduced. Fix: `>=`.

### D-60 Host cache: `end` does not end a label
`lib/hostauth.c:344-358` (`loadDnewsFeeds`). The skip for lines without an argument runs before
the test for `end`, and `end` has no argument, so the current label is never cleared; an `inhost`
or `host` line after `end` is authorised under the previous label. `char label[255]` is also
never initialised. Reproduced with `dprimehostcache -dump`. diablo's own parser only logs
"unexpected position". Fix: test `end` first and initialise `label`.

### D-61 diablo.hosts cannot hold an IPv6 address
`lib/hostauth.c:303-306` splits the line with `strtok(p, ": \t\r\n")`, so `2001:db8::25 mylabel`
becomes host `2001` (which resolves to 0.0.7.209) and label `db8`. The IPv6 peer is not
authorised and a made-up IPv4 address is. The `IP:` and `FQDN:` prefix is stripped before the
address is converted. Verified in the host cache dump. Fix: split on white space only.

### D-62 STAT uses a 128-byte path buffer
`util/diablo.c:2384` has `char path[128]`. When the spool path plus `/D.xxxxxxxx/B.xxxx` is
longer than 127 characters, `STAT` of an existing article answers `430 Article expired` while
`HEAD` works. Reproduced with a 125-character spool path. Fix: `PATH_MAX`.

### D-63 dnewslink refile loses flags
`util/dnewslink.c:2640-2648` (`RefilePendingStreams`) and `:1161-1166`. After a lost peer with
streaming entries pending, the refiled lines have no ` H` (header only) and ` C<size>`
(compressed spool) fields, so a later run sends a header-only record as a full article and a
compressed article as plain bytes. The entry in `buf` is also written twice. Reproduced with a
queue of two `... H C50` lines and a peer that drops after the CHECKs. Fix: keep the flags in the
Stream struct and write them back in the queue format.

### D-64 Weighted spool allocation divides by zero
`lib/spool.c:357-363` computes `random() % totw`. The default weight (`spoolSizeGb()`, `:451-452`)
is 0 for a partition under 1 GiB, and `weight 0` (`:738`) is accepted. Reproduced: `allocstrat
weighted` with `weight 0` makes diablo die with SIGFPE at start; the small-partition case is
from reading. Fix: treat a weight <= 0 as 1, or fall back to sequential when the total is 0.

### D-65 dnewsfeeds label name overflows the host cache buffer
`lib/hostauth.c` `loadDnewsFeeds()` copied the label name with `strcpy(label, p)` into `char label[255]`.
A label name of 255 characters or more in dnewsfeeds (a local file) overflowed it when the host cache
was built. Found by go-while in review of #97. Reproduced with a 3000-character name (dprimehostcache
aborts). Fix: a name that does not fit is skipped, with the hosts of its label.

### D-66 dnewslink loses 431-deferred entries
Entries answered 431 sit in the in-memory `deferbuf` (up to 100) and are retried only at the end
of the file or when it reaches 80 (`util/dnewslink.c:1062`, `:1160-1180`, `:1275-1321`). If the
session ends first (the peer answers 400 or goes away and the reconnect fails, SIGTERM) the queue
is rewritten without them. Reproduced: queue a1, a2, a3; the peer answers 431, 431, 400 and closes;
only a3 is left in the queue. Fix: write the deferred entries back with the unsent ones.

### D-67 dcancel -s does not update the history
`dcancel -s` (spool only, no `-h`) rewrites the spool file and shifts the later articles but does
not update the history (`util/dcancel.c:586`). Afterwards the cancelled id still answers `STAT 223`,
and `ARTICLE` of the second id returns the third article's text. `-a` is fine. Reproduced on the
test zone. Fix: refuse `-s` without `-h`, or update the history in every mode.

### D-68 dnewslink with a small maxstream sends one window
`HiWaterMark` is 5, so `StreamPend < NumStream - HiWaterMark` is never true again after the first
window (`util/dnewslink.c:835`, `:2391`). `-M 2` with 6 queued articles sends 2 CHECKs and leaves
4 in the queue. Reproduced. Fix: scale the mark to `NumStream`.

### D-69 dnewslink spins on a compression level zlib rejects
A level zlib rejects (dnewsfeeds `compress 12`, giving `-Z12`) makes `deflateInit` fail while
`CompressOn` stays set, and `flushCompressBuffer` loops forever (`util/dnewslink.c:1945-1948`,
`:2877`). Reproduced. Fix: clear `CompressOn` (and log) when `deflateInit` fails. The session-end
compression line also logs `-nan%` or `-inf%` for a session without data and passes int32
counters to `%ld` (`util/dnewslink.c:2799-2805`, found by go-while); fixed in the same PR.

### D-70 dgrpctl checkgroups reads long lines as two
`fgets` into `buf[128]` (`util/dgrpctl.c:683`) reads a line of 128 bytes or more as two lines, and
the tail becomes a phantom group on `exec`. An empty list leaves `hierarchy` NULL and the delete
scan calls `WildCmp(NULL, ...)`: SIGSEGV (`:843`). Both reproduced. Fix: read whole lines and
skip a list without a hierarchy.


### D-72 dnewslink deletes the queue after an overlong line
A damaged queue file with a line of 4 to 8 KB and no newline makes `readline` fail for good and
`dnewslink` removes the whole queue file (`util/dnewslink.c:3434`, `:1289`, `:1321`). Reproduced.
Fix: skip the line, keep the file.

### D-73 dnewslink queue fields leak into the next line
`extractFeedLine` sets `cSize`, `fileOff`, `fileSize` and `queuedTime` only when the field is
present, so a plain line after a `C50` line inherits `C50`; `readretry()` rebuilds retried lines
without the H/C flags (`util/dnewslink.c:3890-3910`, `:3329`). Reproduced: z0 plain, z1 `C50`, z2
plain, with a reconnect: z2 is written back as `200,100 C50`. D-63 fixed only the refile text.
The refile path (`util/dnewslink.c:2688`) writes " H" from the global `HeaderOnlyFeed`, so
keeping the flags in `readretry` is not enough on its own. Fix: reset the fields per line; keep the
flags in `readretry`.

### D-74 dnewslink queue rewrite write errors are unchecked
`fputs`, `fflush` and `fclose` of the rewritten queue file are not checked before the rename over
the queue (`util/dnewslink.c:1289-1321`); a full disk replaces the queue with a truncated one.
From reading. Fix: check them and keep the old queue on failure; same PR as D-72.


### D-76 dexpire removes a directory younger than keeptime
After removing a directory, `part->age` is taken from `SpoolEntries[i+1]`, the next entry of the
globally sorted list, which can belong to another spool or partition when the directory times
interleave (`util/dexpire.c:739-740`, age test `:675`). Reproduced: spool 01 with directories 180,
42 and 12 minutes old, spool 02 with 120 and 90, keeptime 3600: the 42-minute directory is removed.
Fix: take the next entry of the same partition, as the newest-directory guard at `:706` does.

### D-77 dhisexpire without -a leaves the history dead
A successful `dhisexpire` without `-a` leaves the live `dhistory` marked dead (`util/dhisexpire.c`
`DeadFd`); new connections get no greeting until `dhisexpire -u`. **Documented behaviour**, not a
regression from #95: `man/dhisexpire.8` says the old file's magic is marked invalid when the
rewrite completes and `-u` makes it usable again (checked by go-while on the tree before #95 and on
main). What is missing is a note: print one at the end of a run without `-a` and in the usage text.

### D-78 dicmd config internalfilter disables the spam filter
Even for an unchanged value: `termSpamData()` sets `fi->Fd = -1` but not `BodyFilterFd` and
`NphFilterFd`, so the following `InitSpamFilter()` skips `openFilterFile()`
(`lib/spamfilter.c:356`, `:376-403`; `lib/config.c:667-672`, `util/diablo.c:4246-4250`). `dicmd
info` still says enabled. Reproduced: `internalfilter B3`, 12 identical bodies: 2 stored before the
change, 12 after. Fix: reset all three descriptors in `termSpamData()`.

### D-79 KPDB blank or short line
The sort writes 8 hex digits at `i+1` whatever the line length;
`KPDBLookupBinary` recurses forever on a range that is just the blank line (stack overflow, SIGSEGV)
(`lib/kpdb.c:1238-1254`, the recursion at `:1168-1171`). The 8-digit write corrupts only lines
shorter than 9 bytes. Needs a hand-edited or damaged file (the header documents
manual editing). Reproduced: `dkp -r` crashes with 3 of 4 records left.

### D-80 KPDB torn tail loses appends
`KPDBWrite` appends at the end without looking at the last byte, and the lookup from the end needs
`'\n'` (`lib/kpdb.c:791-851`, `:1005-1006`). After a crash (a half-written record, or a NUL block
on ext4 or XFS) the first record appended is glued onto the torn tail, `dkp` exits 0, and no
lookup finds it (the lookup scans backwards, so later appends that end in `'\n'` are found): a lost
group creation. Reproduced. Fix: on write, if the last byte is not `'\n'`, cut back to the last newline
or write one first.

### D-81 The sample internalfilter line turns the filter off
`samples/diablo.config:400` shows `internalfilter B6s32768 N16t7200`; the expire option is `e`, so
`t` is invalid, `SetSpamFilterOpt` logs to syslog only, and the filter stays off
(`lib/spamfilter.c:134`, `:207-211`). Copying the example turns the filter off silently. Fix the
sample; maybe make an invalid string a config error.

### D-82 Long config lines are split
`diablo.config` is read with `buf[256]` (`lib/config.c:158`, `:190`): a 422-character comment line
makes every Diablo program exit with "Unknown diablo.config command". `dspool.ctl` (`lib/spool.c:575`) and `dexpire.ctl` (`lib/expire.c:73`) use `MAXGNAME+256`
buffers and split only above about 512 characters (from reading); the 256-byte case is
`diablo.config`, which is reproduced.

### D-83 Indented dexpire.ctl line is ignored
After skipping white space the pattern is copied from `buf` instead of `p` (`lib/expire.c:104`), so
`   e2e.*:a4000` matches nothing. Reproduced.


### D-85 dhisexpire treats a read error as end of file
`n = read()` returning -1 is handled like 0 (`util/dhisexpire.c:331`, the `n == 0` test at `:333`): an EIO ends the copy, and
with `-a` a truncated history is installed (the old one stays as the backup). From reading.

### D-86 Spool number off by one
`spool > MAX_SPOOL_OBJECTS` should be `>=` (`lib/spool.c:126`, `:150`); a history record with exp
200 reads `SpoolObjectMap[100]`. From reading.

### D-88 dnewslink -p overwrites leftover lines of an earlier run
With `-p` the batch file receives only the leftover lines, and a later pipe run opens it with
`fopen("w")` (`util/dnewslink.c`, final queue rewrite), so it overwrites the leftovers of the earlier
run even when nothing fails. Older behaviour, found while reviewing D-72/D-74. From reading.

### D-87 Numeric IPv6 host in diablo.hosts dropped on a machine without IPv6
`lib/hostauth.c:240` called `getaddrinfo(host, NULL, NULL, ...)`. With NULL hints glibc uses
`AI_ADDRCONFIG|AI_V4MAPPED`, and on glibc 2.39 (EL10) `AI_ADDRCONFIG` also drops a numeric IPv6
address when the machine has no non-loopback IPv6 address: `getaddrinfo("2001:db8::25")` fails with
`EAI_ADDRFAMILY`, so an IPv6 `diablo.hosts` entry is silently ignored. Found by go-while's matrix
run (`TestHostCacheDiabloHostsForms` failed on AlmaLinux 10, CentOS Stream 10 and Rocky 10). Fixed
with explicit hints (#115).

### D-89 AI_ADDRCONFIG still passed for listen, bind and connect addresses
`dreaderd/main.c:485` (listen, `AI_PASSIVE|AI_ADDRCONFIG`), `dreaderd/server.c:401` (connect and
bindhost) and `util/dsyncgroups.c:906` still pass `AI_ADDRCONFIG`. On a glibc 2.39 host without a
global IPv6 address a numeric IPv6 listen, bind or connect address (for example `::1`) fails with
`EAI_ADDRFAMILY`. Same cause as D-87. From reading (found in the reviews of D-87).

## Feature requests

### F-01 Cancel-Lock (RFC 8315)
Generate `Cancel-Lock` for local posts in dreaderd and verify `Cancel-Key` before executing a
cancel or supersede. The maintainer's main reason not to replace INN with diablo plus
dreaderd yet.

**Verification: done in #19.** `CtlCancel` (`dreaderd/control.c`) checks the Cancel-Key of a
cancel or supersede against the target's Cancel-Lock (`lib/canlock.c`; sha256, sha512 and
sha1). `readercanlock` in diablo.config:

- `require-auth` (default): executed only when the target has a Cancel-Lock and the Cancel-Key
  matches it; a target without a lock is not cancelled.
- `auth`: a target with a Cancel-Lock needs a matching key; a target without one is cancelled.
- `none`: no cancel or supersede is executed.
- `all`: no checks (the behaviour before #19).

A cancel that arrives before its target is dropped unless the mode is `all`. Trackonly mode
is refused with a Cancel-Lock check enabled. Tests: `TestCanLockVectors`, `TestCancelLock*`.
Upgrades: a reader that relied on unchecked cancels must set `readercanlock all`.

**Generation: open.** Adding `Cancel-Lock` (and `Cancel-Key` on a poster's own cancels) in
`NNPostBuffer` (`dreaderd/post.c`) with OpenSSL HMAC, byte-identical to INN's locks; then a
key tool. Waiting for the decision on sha1 (INN still generates it next to sha256) and on
secret storage.
